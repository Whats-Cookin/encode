Dear {{ user.username }},

We want to take a moment to express our gratitude for registering a trading account with us.
It's always a pleasure to trade with clients who understand the importance of securing their buy and sell transactions through our platform.
 
Additionally, I wanted to inform you that you can start trading right away. However,
we kindly ask that you upload a means of identification on the KYC verification section of your dashboard.
This step is crucial in ensuring the safety of your funds and complying with the necessary regulations.
 
If you have any questions or concerns about the verification process, 
please don't hesitate to reach out to our customer support team on our website or contact [support@xendex.com.ng]. 
They will be happy to assist you in any way they can.
 
Thank you again for your business, and we look forward to working with you further.

Warm Regards, 
 
 
ThexendexTeam.
